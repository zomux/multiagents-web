            <li><strong>Communication Protocols and Knowledge Sharing:</strong> How do we design effective protocols for inter-agent communication and knowledge sharing? What mechanisms enable agents to share and update their knowledge bases while balancing expressiveness, efficiency, and specialization?</li>
            
            <li><strong>Trust and Verification:</strong> How can we build trust in multi-agent systems? What mechanisms should be in place to verify the accuracy and reliability of inter-agent communications?</li>
            
            <li><strong>Responsible AI in Multi-Agent Systems:</strong> How do we ensure responsible development and deployment of multi-agent systems? What governance frameworks and safeguards should be in place to ensure alignment with human values and societal benefits?</li>
            
            <li><strong>Learning in Multi-Agent Environments:</strong> What are the unique challenges and opportunities in multi-agent learning compared to single-agent learning? How can we effectively train agents to collaborate?</li>
            
            <li><strong>Human-AI Collaboration:</strong> How do multi-agent systems change the dynamics of human-AI collaboration? What new interfaces and interaction patterns are needed?</li>
            
            <li><strong>Coordinating Agents with Different/Competing Goals:</strong> How do we effectively manage and orchestrate agents with diverse or conflicting objectives? What mechanisms can help balance individual agent goals with system-level objectives?</li>
            
            <li><strong>Modeling Uncertainty in Large Scale Multi-agent Environments:</strong> How do we effectively model and handle uncertainties in complex multi-agent systems? What approaches can help maintain system stability and reliability at scale?</li>
            
            <li><strong>Emergent Behaviors in Multi-Agent Systems:</strong> How do we understand and control emergent behaviors when multiple LLM-based agents interact? What are the implications for safety and reliability?</li>
            
            <li><strong>Applications of LLM-based Multi-Agent Collaboration:</strong> What are the most promising real-world applications and use cases for LLM-based multi-agent systems? How do we identify domains where multi-agent approaches provide significant advantages over single-agent solutions?</li>
            
            <li><strong>Future Directions:</strong> What are the most promising research directions for advancing multi-agent collaboration? What are the key technical and societal challenges we need to address?</li>
