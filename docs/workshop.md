# Call for Participation

We invite submissions to the **AAAI 2025 Workshop on Advancing LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration**, to be held in Philadelphia during the AAAI 2025 conference (February 25 - March 4, 2025).

## Overview:
This is an one-day workshop aiming to facilitate discussion on emerging research areas and challenges related to multi-agent collaboration driven by large language models (LLMs). As LLMs demonstrate increasing potential to orchestrate multi-agent systems for complex problem-solving, this workshop will explore key research questions around agent hierarchy, social systems, information sharing, communication protocols, decentralized collaboration, group behavior learning, multi-agent planning, and guardrails.

We welcome submissions on topics including, but not limited to:

- Multi-agent collaboration structures, hierarchy and decision making
- Cross-agent knowledge sharing 
- Inter-agent communication protocols
- Distributed and decentralized agents
- Multi-agent group behavior learning
- Strategic planning for multi-agent problem-solving
- Guardrails and responsible behaviors in multi-agent systems

## Submission Guidelines:

[TBD]
<!-- We invite submissions of both short papers (up to 4 pages) and long papers (up to 8 pages) in AAAI format. We welcome work at all stages, including recently published work, work under submission elsewhere, work in progress, and position papers. Submissions will be peer-reviewed in a single-blind process. -->
