# Virtual Attendance Guidelines

This page provides essential information for all virtual participants at WMAC 2025.

## Joining Virtual Sessions

### Access Information
- The zoom link to the live sessions can be found in the Underline: https://underline.io/events/486/sessions?eventSessionId=19383&searchGroup=lecture
- For Q&A, due to the tight schedule, the session chairs are likely to prioritize very few questions for offline participants. Feel free to ask questions by posting them on the online discussion group, we will collect these questions and follow up with corresponding speakers offline.

## Online Discussion
- For online discussion, we have created a discussion group on Whova: https://whova.com/portal/webapp/aaai_202502/CommunityBoard/topic/2710278
- The workshop chairs will monitor the discussion group and answer questions as much as possible.

## Virtual Poster Presentations

Please check the [workshop page](/workshop) for accessing PDF files for all posters. Some authors have provided videos for their posters.
